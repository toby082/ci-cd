## Next.js CI / CD on AWS with GitHub Actions and the Serverless Framework

This is an example project showing how to integrate a CI / CD pipeline for your Next.js app on AWS.

This project uses the [Serverless Next.js Component](https://github.com/serverless-nextjs/serverless-next.js) to deploy a Next.js app to AWS complete with Cloudfront and Lambda at Edge â€“ enabling you to take advantage of Next.js features like SSR, fallback routes, API routes, and revalidation.
